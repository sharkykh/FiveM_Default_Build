## How to use?

Note: You only need to do this once (until you reinstall FiveM).  

- Download the EXE file and run it.
- Windows might show a blue SmartScreen warning, you will need to click "More info" and then "Run anyway" at the buttom of the window.
- Select the appropriate game build version or "Unset" to clear the default game build setting.
- Click "‚úè Set".
- Done!

## Supported game builds

- b1604
- b2060
- b2189

## How does this work?

This small utility changes the `SavedBuildNumber` game setting in `CitizenFX.ini` at FiveM's installation folder.  
By default that file path is:
```
%localappdata%\FiveM\FiveM.app\CitizenFX.ini
```
